Desktop Search Engine:
-----------------------

We can search for files based on the text content present within that file.
Or in a generic way, we can also search based on the file type.

Step 1:
-------
Install the dependencies using reqirements.txt using the below line of code
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 2:
--------
Execute the Main.py which will create a Db for the files and words in the given directory.
"Its a one-time process that has to be executed."

Step 3:
--------
Execute the retrieval.py which searches based on user input & retrieves the top 5 matching files.
